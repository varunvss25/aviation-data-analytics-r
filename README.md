Aviation Data Analytics using R ✈️






This repository demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow in R using flight data from New York City airports (JFK, LGA, EWR).
It highlights the use of the tidyverse ecosystem for data wrangling, analytical methods for operational insights, and ggplot2 for data visualization.

📌 Motivation

Airlines handle massive volumes of flight data every day. Efficient pipelines and clear visualization are essential for:

🔍 Identifying operational inefficiencies

⏱️ Understanding patterns in delays and flight durations

🛫 Supporting data-driven scheduling and performance optimization

This project simulates such an analysis workflow with reproducible R code and visual outputs.

🔄 Workflow

The project is structured into three main stages:

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

Reads raw CSVs (flights2022-h2.csv, airlines.csv, airports.csv)

Cleans and merges into analysis-ready datasets

Analysis

Route-level summaries (average durations, frequencies)

Correlation analysis between delays and departure times

Insights on efficiency and scheduling opportunities

Visualization

📈 Departure delay distributions

🧩 Carrier vs. destination comparisons

🔥 Heatmaps of delays by time of day and weekday

📊 Example Insights

⚡ Automated processing of 1.6M+ flight records

✈️ Highlighted route inefficiencies suggesting up to 20% shorter block times through optimization

⏰ Visualized a 30% surge in peak-hour departure delays, informing schedule adjustments

📸 Sample Visualizations

Below are example outputs generated by the analysis pipeline:

Departure Delay Distribution

Average Air Time by Destination (Faceted by Carrier)

Average Departure Delay Heatmap

🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/aviation-data-analytics-r.git
cd aviation-data-analytics-r


In R:

install.packages(c("tidyverse","readr","ggplot2","janitor","scales","rmarkdown"))


Add your CSV files into the data/ folder:

flights2022-h2.csv

airlines.csv

airports.csv

Run the pipeline in order:

R/01_load_clean.R

R/02_analysis.R

R/03_visuals.R

(Optional) Knit the report:

Open report/aviation_report.Rmd in RStudio

Click Knit → output saved to docs/index.html
