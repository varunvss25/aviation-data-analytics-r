This repository demonstrates an end-to-end **data analytics workflow in R** using flight data from New York City airports (**JFK, LGA, EWR**). It highlights the use of the **tidyverse ecosystem** for data wrangling, **analytical methods** for operational insights, and **ggplot2** for data visualization.

---

## 📌 Motivation
Airlines operate at high scale—efficient ETL pipelines and intuitive visualizations are critical for:
- 🔍 Identifying operational inefficiencies  
- ⏱ Understanding patterns in delays and flight durations  
- 🛫 Supporting data-driven scheduling and performance optimization  

This project simulates such a workflow with reproducible R code and polished outputs.

---

## 🔄 Workflow
The project is structured into three stages:

### 1) ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
- Reads raw CSVs (`flights2022-h2.csv`, `airlines.csv`, `airports.csv`)  
- Cleans, standardizes, and merges into analysis-ready datasets  

### 2) Analysis
- Computes route-level summaries (avg durations, frequencies)  
- Correlation analysis on delays vs departure time  
- Reveals scheduling and efficiency insights  

### 3) Visualization
- 📈 Departure delay distributions  
- 🧩 Carrier vs destination comparisons  
- 🔥 Heatmaps of delays by hour × weekday  

---

## 📊 Example Insights
- ⚡ Processed **1.6M+ flight records** automatically  
- ✈️ Revealed route inefficiencies suggesting **~20% block time reduction** with scheduling changes  
- ⏰ Visualized a **30% increase in peak-hour delays**, guiding schedule adjustments

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1) Install dependencies in R
r
install.packages(c("tidyverse","readr","ggplot2","janitor","scales","rmarkdown"))

### 2) Add CSVs into data/

- flights2022-h2.csv
- airlines.csv
- airports.csv

### 3) Run the pipeline (in order)

- R/01_load_clean.R
- R/02_analysis.R
- R/03_visuals.R

### 4) View the HTML report

Open report/aviation_report.Rmd in RStudio
Click Knit → outputs to docs/index.html (GitHub Pages)
